# Maia
Hey there. I'm Maia. I'm a software & devops engineer based in London. I'm the CTO and co-founder of [Honeybank Studios](https://honeybankstudios.com), and love learning new stuff!

## Coding
When it comes to backend, I have a lot of Golang experience, by far my main and most loved language. I've also done a lot with Node.JS but it's not my primary language. When it comes to frontend, I've worked a lot with Vue (more specifically Nuxt), although when possible I just do plain HTML like with TweetShift's site, because sometimes you don't need a ton of Javascript on the frontend for no reason *cough cough literally most modern websites*. When I have more time I want to learn Rust and Elixir. 

## DevOps
I've been quite into Serverless recently with things like Lambda and Cloud Run, but I also still love a traditional server setup - of course! I'm highly experienced in DevOps including deploying, testing, maintenance, ci/cd, and all of those goodies. I've deployed things from small projects in Docker to huge Kubernetes deployments spanning lots of nodes, as well as multi-node databases such as CockroachDB and Scylla - and more traditional databases such as PostgreSQL and MariaDB. I've also worked with MongoDB, but personally prefer SQL.
