# Maia
Main projects: [TweetShift](https://tweetshift.com), [Assistcord](https://assistcord.com), and something new I'll be announcing soon!

Side projects: [Slashy](https://github.com/maiacodes/slashy), [Eutenly](https://eutenly.com), and a lot of smaller React and Vue things for clients.

## Coding
When it comes to backend, I have a lot of Golang experience, by far my main and most loved language. I've also done a lot with Node.JS but I don't like it as much as I used to, it gets boring quickly. When it comes to frontend, unlike a lot of frontend devs, I stan Vue (more specifically Nuxt) instead of React, although when I can I also just do plain HTML like with TweetShift's site, because sometimes you don't need a ton of Javascript on the frontend for no reason *cough cough literally most modern websites*. When I have more time I want to learn Rust and Elixir. 

## DevOps
I've been quite into Serverless recently with things like Lambda and Cloud Run, but I also still love a traditional server setup - of course! I'm fully experienced in DevOps including deploying, testing, maintenance, ci/cd, and all of that junk. I've deployed things from small projects in Docker to huge Kubernetes deployments spanning lots of nodes, as well as multi-node databases such as CockroachDB and Scylla - and more traditional databases such as PostgreSQL and MariaDB. I'm not a huge fan of MongoDB but I still do a lot with it!
