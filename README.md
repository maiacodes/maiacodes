# Maia
Main projects: [TweetShift](https://tweetshift.com), [Assistcord](https://assistcord.com), and [Eutenly](https://eutenly.com).

Other projects: [Slashy](https://github.com/maiacodes/slashy) and a lot of smaller React and Vue things for clients.

## Programming Languages
When it comes to backend, I have a lot of Golang experience, by far my main and most loved language. I've also done a lot with Node.JS but I don't like it as much as I used to, it gets boring quickly. When it comes to frontend, unlike a lot of frontend devs, I stan Vue (more specifically Nuxt) instead of React, although when I can I also just do plain HTML like with TweetShift's site, because sometimes you don't need a ton of Javascript on the frontend for no reason *cough cough literally most modern websites*. When I have more time I want to learn Rust and Elixir.
